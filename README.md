SEPT 2024

The purpose of this project was to re-familarise myself with python after a summer break. 

I was finding the practical session tasks for my programming module too easy, so decided to pre-occupy the rest of my time working on this.

Unfortunately I didn't get time to make any visuals for it, so it looks extremely basic, but the main thing is that the core gameplay is there and working as it should.
